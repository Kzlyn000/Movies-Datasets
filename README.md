LEN Functions
  The **LEN functions**(length) is a function in excel categorized under text functions which returns the length of the specified string including the letters, numbers, characters, and all spaces. This function can be useful if we wish to get the length of a given text string as the number of characters in a given cell. To apply this function use the formula:
 
 ** Syntax =LEN(text)**
 
For example, if the cell _**A2**_ contains the text _"Move to Heaven"_, the formula =LEN(A2), would return _**14**_. This shows that there are 14 character in the text **Move to Heaven**.
